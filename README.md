# Diffusion Models Experiment

This repository contains code and generated images from an experiment using latent diffusion models for image generation.

## Description

We conduct experiments centered around latent diffusion models. Our work primarily involves using these models for text-to-image generation, quantitative analysis of image diversity, and enhancing image variety within specific categories. Explore my experiments to see how latent diffusion models are applied in these practical scenarios.

## Experiment Stages

### Stage 1: Image Generation
In the first stage of our experiment, we focused on text-to-image generation using latent diffusion models. We generated a collection of realistic images, all belonging to a specific category. The goal was to showcase creativity and proficiency in working with text-to-image models.

### Stage 2: Quantify Semantic and Style Divergence
Following the image generation, we delved into quantifying the semantic and style divergence of the generated images within the chosen category. We designed a strategy to automatically assess how these images differed in terms of content and artistic style. This stage demonstrated our analytical skills and image analysis expertise.

### Stage 3: Enlarging Image Diversity
In the final stage, we aimed to significantly increase the diversity of a new set of generated images, staying within the same category as in Stage 1. Our objective was to introduce substantial changes in diversity, showcasing creativity and problem-solving abilities.
